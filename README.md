SWEN-101 Assignment

Hi, I'm Dominick Polakowski. I went to Riverhead Senior High School in Riverhead, Long Island. 
I am ethnically Polish as my parents both moved here 3 years before I was born. 
Polish was my first language. Some of my hobbies are playing trombone (Music in general), 
Working out, and hanging out with friends.
